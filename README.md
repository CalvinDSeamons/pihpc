*A Lightweight Mini Supercomputer Testbed*  

PiHPC is a **barebones, lightweight high-performance computing (HPC) cluster testbed** built for experimentation, demos, and hands-on learning.  
This repository serves as a **launchpad for HPC systems design** using modern infrastructure tooling such as **Ansible, Kubernetes, SLURM, Splunk, and Grafana**.  

Think of it as a **mini supercomputer lab** you can run anywhere — perfect for testing configs, workflows, and monitoring pipelines before scaling to real HPC environments.

## ✨ Features  

- 🛠️ **Infrastructure-as-Code** with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for cluster provisioning  
- ☸️ **Containerized workflows** via [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)  
- ⏱️ **Job scheduling** with [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/)  
- 📊 **Observability stack** with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/)  
- 🔌 **Scalable design demos** — networking configs, storage backends, and cluster layout examples  
- 🧩 **Pluggable examples**: toy workloads, monitoring dashboards, and cluster workflows

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Rocky recommended)  
- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 🔧 [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html)  
- ☸️ [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/)  
- ⏱️ [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html)  

### Setup Steps  

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pihpc.git
cd pihpc

# Run base Ansible provisioning
ansible-playbook ansible/cluster.yml

# Deploy Kubernetes components
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/

# Launch monitoring stack
kubectl apply -f monitoring/
```

📊 Example Workflows
- Submit a SLURM job to run a toy MPI benchmark
- Monitor cluster health & metrics in Grafana
- Send logs and job events into Splunk for indexing & searching
- Deploy a containerized workload with Kubernetes and compare performance vs. bare metal
